Mobile application for nurses to capture and print details of patients

The app is built to cater for nurses that have to print time schedules for patients. These tables and data have to be printable.

The app is a work in progress and will require future projects like:
o-Connecting to a service
o-Adding additional pages for differnt parts of a hospital
o-UI changes will have to change as the app progresses
